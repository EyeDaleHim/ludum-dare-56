Project Plan for "Tiny Realms: Micro Civilizations"
1. Core Mechanics and Features

    Autotile (FlxTileMap)
        Set up autotiling to simplify map creation, ensuring seamless terrain transitions.
    Level View (FlxTileMap)
        Autotiling: Develop and implement a complete tile-based map with dynamic autotiling for terrain and environmental features.
        Pathfinding: Integrate an efficient pathfinding system (A* or similar) for NPC movement across the map.
        Map Size: Set up the overworld level with dimensions of 2048x2048 pixels.
        Camera: Implement camera controls (zoom, pan) to allow players to navigate the large map smoothly.

2. Procedural Generation

    BSP (Binary Space Partitioning)
        Use BSP for creating distinct, varied areas within the map (e.g., village zones, forest zones, resources).
    Perlin Terrainmap Generator
        Utilize Perlin noise for creating smooth, natural terrain features such as hills, valleys, and rivers.

3. User Interface (UI)

    Title Screen
        Design a visually engaging title screen, with the game logo, theme music, and menu options.
    Settings Screen
        Include settings for adjusting sound, music volume, controls, screen resolution, and other gameplay preferences.
    New Game Screen
        Provide options to start a new game, select game difficulty, or customize initial civilization features.
    Load Game Screen
        Implement a screen for selecting saved games, allowing players to resume previous sessions.
    HUD (Heads-Up Display)
        Custom Metrics: Design a HUD to display civilization metrics, such as population, resources (food, wood, gold), happiness, and other important game indicators.

4. Gameplay and Mechanics

    AI (Artificial Intelligence)
        Develop AI for villagers, warriors, and other units, allowing for autonomous behavior such as resource collection, combat, and decision-making.
        Rival AI Civilizations: Implement basic AI for neighboring factions, capable of trading, forming alliances, and engaging in conflict.

5. Graphics

    Tilemap Graphics
        Design and refine 16x16 tiles for various terrains (grass, dirt, water, rock) and structures (houses, walls, farms).
    Creature Sprites
        Create tiny 16x16 creature sprites, including villagers, warriors, wizards, and mythological beings.
    Building and Structure Sprites
        Design small structures such as houses, resource-gathering buildings, monuments, and defensive structures.
    Animations
        Add simple animations for resource gathering, construction, and combat to bring the world to life.

6. Sound and Music

    Sound Effects
        Create sound effects for key actions like resource collection, construction, combat, and menu navigation. Sounds should have a nostalgic 16-bit feel.
    Background Music (BGM)
        Compose or source retro-style background music to enhance the atmosphere. Include different tracks for different scenarios (e.g., peaceful village music, battle theme).

7. Game Logic and Systems

    Resource System
        Implement core resources (food, wood, stone, gold) and logic for resource generation, collection, and expenditure.
    Building and Expansion System
        Allow players to construct and upgrade structures. Ensure buildings contribute positively to metrics like population capacity and resource efficiency.
    Tech Tree and Upgrades
        Create a simple tech tree allowing players to research upgrades, leading to better buildings, stronger units, and new abilities.
    Combat and Defense
        Develop a simple combat system for defending the village from threats. Include basic attack and health values for units.

8. Procedural Gameplay Elements

    Random Events
        Add random events to make gameplay dynamic (e.g., attacks by predators, visiting traders, changing weather).
    Exploration
        Include areas that are initially shrouded in fog-of-war, encouraging players to explore the 2048x2048 map.

9. Game Flow and User Experience

    Tutorial
        Develop a brief, interactive tutorial to introduce players to the game mechanicsâ€”how to gather resources, build structures, and interact with AI civilizations.
    Quests and Objectives
        Implement quests and goals for players to achieve, helping guide progression and maintain engagement.
    Narrative Integration
        Tie gameplay elements into the story-driven narrative to enhance player immersion. Include dialogues with other factions, cutscenes, and storyline progression.

10. Polish and Playtesting

    Bug Fixing
        Regularly playtest and fix bugs related to pathfinding, UI, and AI behaviors.
    Balancing
        Ensure balancing of resource generation, AI difficulty, and combat to make the gameplay challenging but fair.
    Optimization
        Optimize graphics and AI logic to maintain smooth performance, particularly in a large map environment.

11. Deployment and Submission

    Build and Export
        Compile the game into executable formats for multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, Mac, web).
    Testing on Target Platforms
        Test the game on different platforms to ensure smooth functioning.
    Final Submission
        Ensure all required assets, build files, and documentation are ready for submission for the Ludum Dare deadline.
